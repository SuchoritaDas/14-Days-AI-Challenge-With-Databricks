# Day 14 — AI-Powered Analytics with Genie & Mosaic AI

Day 14 focuses on how artificial intelligence can directly support business analytics using natural language and AI models.
This day shows how data platforms are moving from manual querying to AI-assisted insights.
## 🔍 What I Learned
Today introduced two powerful concepts:
Genie
Allows users to ask questions in plain English
Converts natural language into analytics queries
Makes data accessible to non-technical users
Mosaic AI
Supports generative AI and NLP use cases
Helps build AI models on top of data platforms
Enables AI-assisted analytics workflows
## 🛠 What I Implemented
I completed the following tasks:
Used Genie to ask business questions like:
Total revenue by category
Highest conversion products
Daily purchase trends
Customers who viewed but never purchased
Explored Mosaic AI features for AI-assisted analysis.
Built a simple NLP sentiment analysis model using a transformer pipeline.
Logged the AI model into MLflow, including:
Model name
Example accuracy metric
Run tracking
## 🤖 Sample AI Task
I used a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify product reviews as positive or negative.
The results were tracked using MLflow so they can be compared and monitored later.
This demonstrates how AI + analytics + tracking work together in modern data systems.
## 📈 Why This Matters
AI-powered analytics helps:
Reduce dependency on SQL
Speed up business decision making
Allow non-technical users to explore data
Combine machine learning with real analytics workflows
This is the future of data platforms.
🧠 Key Takeaway
Day 14 showed how AI is no longer separate from analytics — it is becoming part of everyday data work.
