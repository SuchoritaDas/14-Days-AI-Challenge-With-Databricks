# Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge  
Day 13 – Model Comparison & Feature Engineering

This day focuses on training multiple machine learning models, comparing their performance using MLflow, and building a Spark ML pipeline for scalable model workflows.

## 🚀 What I Worked On
- Trained three models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest  
- Logged parameters, metrics, and models to MLflow  
- Compared R² scores to select the best model  
- Built a Spark ML pipeline using VectorAssembler and Linear Regression  

##  🧠 Concepts Covered
- Model experimentation & comparison  
- Hyperparameter tuning basics  
- Feature importance & selection  
- Spark ML Pipelines  

##  🛠 Tech Stack
Databricks  
Apache Spark  
MLflow  
Python  
PySpark  
Scikit-learn  

## 📂 Key Implementation Highlights
- Used MLflow runs for each model  
- Logged model type and R² score  
- Registered trained models  
- Built Spark pipeline with feature assembler  

## 📈 Outcome
- Compared multiple models in a single experiment  
- Identified the best-performing model  
- Created a reusable Spark ML pipeline  
- Gained hands-on experience with ML lifecycle tracking
