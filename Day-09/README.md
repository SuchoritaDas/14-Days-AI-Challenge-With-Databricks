# Day 9 – SQL Analytics & Dashboards
On Day 9 of the Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge, the focus shifted from data engineering to analytics and business reporting. The goal was to use SQL on curated datasets and extract insights that are meaningful for decision-making.
This day connects data pipelines to real-world use cases like revenue analysis, customer behavior, and performance tracking.
## What I Learned
How SQL warehouses are used for analytical workloads
Writing complex analytical SQL queries
Using window functions for trend analysis
Preparing datasets that can be visualized in dashboards
Translating raw numbers into business insights
## What I Implemented
I worked on the Gold layer data and performed multiple analytical tasks:
Revenue trend analysis
Calculated daily revenue and applied a 7-day moving average to understand performance trends over time.
Conversion funnel analysis
Analyzed how users move from views to purchases and calculated conversion rates across product categories.
Customer segmentation
Classified customers into:
VIP customers (high purchase frequency)
Loyal customers
Regular customers
This helps businesses understand customer value and retention.
Dashboard-ready queries
Wrote clean SQL queries that can directly be used in dashboards for:
Revenue trends
Funnels
Top products
Customer tiers
## Why This Matters
This step shows how data engineering enables analytics teams to:
Track business performance
Identify high-value customers
Monitor growth and conversions
Support leadership decisions with data
It’s where data stops being technical and starts becoming useful.
