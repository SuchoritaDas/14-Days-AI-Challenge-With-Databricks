# Day 01 – Platform Setup & First Steps
On Day 1 of the Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge, I set up my Databricks environment and learned how the platform works at a foundational level.
This day focused on understanding the ecosystem before starting real data analysis.
## What I did
Created a Databricks Community Edition account
Explored Workspace, Compute, and Data Explorer
Created my first Databricks notebook
Ran basic PySpark commands
## What I learned
Why Databricks is used instead of Pandas or Hadoop
Basics of Lakehouse Architecture
How data lakes and data warehouses work together
How companies like Netflix, Shell, and Comcast use Databricks for large-scale data processing
## Key takeaway
This day helped me understand how modern data platforms are structured and how Databricks connects storage, processing, and analytics in one place.
It gave me the foundation I needed before working with real datasets.
